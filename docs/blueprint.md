# **App Name**: KADD-AI: KPI-Aware Defect Detection AI

## Core Features:

- Defect Detection: Upload an image of sheet steel, and our YOLOv5 model detects surface defects.
- Image Annotation: Generate an annotated image with bounding boxes and defect labels.
- KPI Calculation: Calculate KPIs such as total defects, defect density, defect type frequency, and severity score.
- AI Report Generation: AI-generated report that will summarize findings into an Executive Summary, Key Observations, KPI Highlights, and Recommendations, written in formal business language. This is a tool-based feature.
- Dashboard UI: A dashboard to upload images, visualize detections, display KPIs, read AI reports, and view defect trend charts.
- Report Export: Download reports as PDFs
- Report History: History log of past reports, searchable by date and severity.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Steel blue (#4682B4) to reflect the industry focus, while suggesting trustworthiness and precision.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0), providing a clean and neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: Orange (#FFA500) for call-to-action buttons and highlights to draw attention to critical areas.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif font known for its readability and modern appearance, suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use a consistent set of glyph-style icons to represent actions (upload, download) and defect types. Color code defects in the KPI summaries.
- Use a responsive, grid-based layout to organize elements. Allocate the majority of the space to display the uploaded image with defect detections. Dedicate separate panels for KPI summaries, report, and history log.
- Use subtle transition animations when the report is created, so it feels responsive, and provides good user feedback.
